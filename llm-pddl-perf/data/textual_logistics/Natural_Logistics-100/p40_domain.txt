In the Logistics game, the goal is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Players have several actions at their disposal: A package can be loaded onto a truck or airplane at a specific location as long as both the package and the vehicle are present at that place. Once loaded, the package is no longer considered to be at the original location. To unload a package from a truck or airplane, the vehicle must be at the intended location and contain the package; upon unloading, the package is then at the new location and not within the vehicle anymore. Trucks can be driven from one location to another within the same city, provided the truck starts at the initial location. It's important to note that after driving, the truck relocates to the new destination within the city. Airplanes have the ability to fly between airports; they must begin their journey at the first airport. Once a flight is completed, the airplane is stationed at the second airport, thereby leaving the first. These mechanics combine to form the strategy and challenge of efficiently managing logistics within this game.
