In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations. You can perform a series of actions, such as: loading a package onto a truck if both the package and the truck are at the same place, or loading it onto an airplane under similar conditions. Once loaded, the package is considered to be in the vehicle and not at the original location anymore. Similarly, unloading a package requires the vehicle to be present at a specific location, and once unloaded, the package returns to being at that location. Trucks can be driven between two locations within the same city, provided the truck is already at the starting point. After driving, the truck relocates to the destination point. Planes facilitate movement between airports; you can fly a plane from one airport to another as long as the plane is already at the initial airport. Once flown, the plane arrives at and remains at the target airport. These are the basic mechanics you can use to manage your logistics effectively.
