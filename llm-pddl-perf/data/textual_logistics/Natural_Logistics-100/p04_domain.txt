In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. Here's a breakdown of the actions you can take: 

1. You can load a package onto a truck at a given location, as long as both the package and the truck are present there. For airplanes, you can do the same under similar conditions. 

2. Once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it is considered to be on the vehicle and not at the location anymore. 

3. To unload a package from a truck or airplane, ensure that the vehicle is at the desired location and the package is inside it. Upon unloading, the package is placed at the location and is no longer inside the vehicle. 

4. You can drive a truck from one location to another, but only if both locations are within the same city and the truck is initially at the starting point. After driving, the truck will be at the new location. 

5. Airplanes can be flown between airports as long as the airplane begins at the originating airport. After the flight, the airplane will be at the destination airport. 

These actions and their associated restrictions form the core mechanics of efficiently managing and executing logistical tasks within the game, ensuring packages are moved to their required destinations using the available routes and vehicles.
