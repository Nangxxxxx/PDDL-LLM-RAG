In the Logistics game, your objective is to transport packages between different locations using trucks and airplanes. You can take several actions: Firstly, you can load a package onto a truck at a specific location, or onto an airplane if it is situated there. Once loaded, the package leaves the location and is now in the truck or airplane. Similarly, to unload a package, ensure that the truck or airplane, along with the package, is at the desired location. Upon unloading, the package becomes available at the location and is no longer in the vehicle. When it comes to moving vehicles, you can drive a truck from one location to another within the same city, provided the truck starts at your chosen departure point. After driving, the truck relocates to the destination. Additionally, airplanes can be flown between two airports. This action requires the airplane to begin at the initial airport, after which it will then be found at the destination airport. Remember, the constraints stipulate that all loading, unloading, driving, and flying actions are dependent on the current location of the packages and vehicles. Plan your moves carefully to achieve successful logistics operations.
