In the Logistics game, you are tasked with moving packages around different locations using trucks and airplanes. Here's what you can do: You can load a package onto a truck at a specific location, or onto an airplane if both the package and the airplane are present there. Once you load the package, it leaves the location and is considered inside the truck or airplane. Conversely, you can unload a package from a truck or an airplane at a location, but only if the vehicle is there with the package already inside it. Upon unloading, the package will be present at that location and no longer inside the vehicle. You have the ability to drive trucks between two locations within the same city, conditioned on the truck starting off at the first location. Once you drive, the truck moves to the second location, leaving the first behind. Similarly, you can fly airplanes between airports, provided the airplane is starting at the first airport. Once in flight, the airplane arrives at the new airport, vacating the original one. Keep these rules in mind as you coordinate the movement of packages across cities and through the skies.
