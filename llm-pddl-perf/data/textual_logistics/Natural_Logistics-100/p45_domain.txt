In the Logistics game, your task is to transport packages between various locations using trucks and airplanes. You have several actions to choose from: You can load a package onto a truck or an airplane if both the package and the vehicle are currently at the same location. Be mindful that once a package is loaded onto a truck or airplane, it's no longer available at the original location. To unload a package, ensure that the truck or airplane is at the current location you're unloading to and that the package is inside the vehicle. Once unloaded, the package becomes available at that location and is removed from the truck or airplane. Driving a truck between two locations within the same city requires that the truck is at the starting location. Upon completion, the truck moves to the second location within the same city. Flying involves moving an airplane from one airport to another, starting with the airplane being at the initial airport. After the flight, the airplane reaches the destination airport, leaving the original one behind.
